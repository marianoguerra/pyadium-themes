#version 1.03

# at the moment, must choose between "normal messages (containing spaces) nicely wrapping around pic but messages without spaces dropping down a line (under photo) OR unbreakable messages not dropping but nothing wrapping around pic. Adding "overflow: hidden" to .pp_message allows second behavior. Can I at least make the timestamp move down with it?

#version 1.1

add multiple layered backgrounds and/or -webkit-border-image
	at the moment .pp_sender has "max-height: 96px" because that's as tall as the image is. It would be nice to display the top margin first, then repeat the normal lined (pp_mid) image.

where possible, replace all images with box-shadows, and css-transforms

alternating 
	make alternating messages use 180¡ rotated paper, torn-side up. 
	make 


#version 1.2

disable all photo-stuff when there isn't an incoming buddyicon (using JS).

random paper rotation, pushpin placement, etc (using JS)

#absolute emoticons:
	Use JS to wrap img.emoticons in <span>.
	#text following emotes are hidden
	#can cause horiz scrollbars when it's the last item on the line.
	#can wrap on a line byitself with no paper background when it's the last item on the line. this one isn't a biggie.

make message background (pp_mid ?) bigger so that really long wrapping messages include a circle cutout for three ring binder?

use layered -webkit masks. (Once in webkit release.)

use webkit gradients. (Once in webkit release.)
